--> --> Added onfocus and onblur statements inside each input/text object to point to the hint.  
--> --> Added 'hints' in the error column that will popup when the corresponding field is active.  
--> --> Removed else statement in error checking since it was pointless because there will always at least be a hint.
--> --> Made error column fields vertically align so the popup boxes will appear at the top and not center.
--> (file:include/search.form.php)
--> --> Added two java scripts hintShow() and hintHide().  
--> --> Expanded the column range in searchGroup() since we added a column for hints.

* Corrected TARGET_NAME/TYPE logic.  It caused the label "Target" to be "Target Type".
--> (file:include/edit.form.php)  elseif statement at start of editValue() function change from "TARGET_TYPE" to "TARGET_NAME"
